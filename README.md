# IKTS - I Know The Score

<h3>The Scoring System.</h3><br>
<p>Perfect Score: 30 points. So if Man Utd vs Swansea is 2-1 and you predict 2-1. Note: Predicting 1-2 is considered an incorrect score and gets you -10 points.</p>
<p>Correctly Predicting a draw: 20 points. So if Man Utd vs Swansea is 1-1 and you have predicted 0-0/2-2 etc. Obviously if you predicted 1-1 you would get 30 points for a correct score.</p>
<p>Correct Resut + Correct Goal Difference: 15 points. So If Man Utd vs Swansea is 2-1 and you have predicted 1-0/3-2 etc.</p>
<p>Correct Result: 10 points. So if Man Utd vs Swansea is 2-1 and you predict 2-0/3-1/4-0 etc.</p>
<p>Incorrect Result: -10 points. Pretty self-explanatory. </p>

<h3>Wildcards</h3>
<p>NOTE: THIS IS NEW EVEN TO THOSE WHO PLAYED LAST YEAR.</p>
<p>Every week you can play two wild cards. One is the Banker card and one is the Insurance card.</p>
<p>Banker: This card doubles your score for that game. So if you get a perfect score on your banker card you double will get 60 points rather than 30 points. Likewise if you get an incorrect result on your banker card you will get -20 points instead of -10.</p>
<p>Insurance: This card means that even you get an incorrect result for that game you will still get 0 points. It has no effect on any positive scores.</p>
<p>You can only play one of each, each week.</p>

<h3>Failing to Send In Predictions</h3>
<p>Last year if you forgot to send in your predictions. You got -10 points for every game. This meant some weeks you had people on -100 points and the next lowest person on 30 points, which meant 130 point swing. This is quite a lot. This year to try and make it a bit fairer we will try the following rules.</p>
<p>If you forget to predict, your score will be 35 points lower than the next lowest score of the people who actually predicted.</p> 
<p>This will not be the case if:*</p>
<p>-	The next lowest score is >=35 points. Non Predictors will then receive a score of -5 points. Non predictors should at least receive some sort of  negative figure for the week.</p>
<p>-	The next lowest score – 35 points is lower than the score you would have got had you received -10 points for every game.</p><p> Hopefully this makes sense – If someone else has a ‘mare, you shouldn’t score less than the lowest score.</p>
